# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10: Building an app to scrape websites for data pertaining to the Mission to Mars, and then creating a HTML page to display my findings. 

## Resources

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- MongoDB
- Visual Studio Code
- Flask
- Data: app.py, scraping.py, Mission_to_Mars.ipynb, index.html

## Overview of Project

In this module, I am being asked to automate a web browser to be able to visit a plethora of websites and extract data about a Mission to Mars. After doing this, the extracted data will then be stored in a NoSQL database and then rendered in a web application created through the use of Flask. With these steps completed, I shall display this work in my own portfolio. For this challenge, the web app that  have created is working, but I am asked to further polish it. This polish is to be found through the incorporation of scraping from Mars hemispheres online. Specifically, I am being asked to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full resolution images of these Mars's hemispheres. Upon doing this, I will store the scraped data on a Mongo Database, use a selected web app to display this data and lastly, to alter the web design to present the images in a clean and creative format. 

## Results
